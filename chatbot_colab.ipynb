        "## 🚀 **Introduction**  \n",
        "This project focuses on building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI chatbot**, which enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating an efficient retrieval system. The chatbot is designed to provide **accurate, context-aware responses** by fetching relevant information from a structured knowledge base before generating answers.  \n",

        "## **Key Concepts**  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Large Language Models (LLMs):**  \n",
        "These are **advanced AI models** capable of understanding and generating human-like text. Examples include **Llama 3, GPT-4, Gemini, and other AI tools** that process vast amounts of language data.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**  \n",
        "RAG enhances LLMs by **retrieving** relevant information from a **vector database** before generating responses. This **improves accuracy** by providing up-to-date and contextual information rather than relying solely on pre-trained knowledge.  \n",
        "\n",
        "By combining these technologies, we create a chatbot that is **intelligent, fast, and capable of reasoning with real-world data**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Why Learn This?**  \n",
        "🔍 **Understand RAG** – Learn how retrieval improves LLM performance.  \n",
        "⚙️ **Hands-On Practice** – Develop a real-world chatbot step-by-step.  \n",
        "🚀 **Beginner Friendly** – No prior experience needed! Everything is explained along the way.  \n",

        "## 🤔 What Are We Building?  \n",
        "In this project, we will develop a **CSUSB Recreation & Wellness AI Chatbot** that intelligently answers questions related to **campus recreation, wellness programs, and student services**. The chatbot will utilize **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and a **vector database** to provide accurate and context-aware responses.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## ✨ Key Features of the Chatbot:  \n",
        "🌐 **CSUSB-Specific Information** – Retrieves and processes data about campus recreation & wellness resources.  \n",
        "🧠 **Contextual Answering** – Uses AI-powered embeddings to match student queries with the most relevant content.  \n",
