Whether you are an experienced athlete or just looking to learn a new sport, we are dedicated to providing our participants enjoyable, innovative and safe activities for all skill levels and interests. Get a team together or join one as a free agent and compete against other CSUSB teams in your favorite sport. Intramural sports are free to all currently enrolled students. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions. CSUSB Intramural Sports believes in the Spirit Of Comptition Sport activities find their origin in the basic human need for the spirit of play. Winning and losing are mere outcomes of this play spirit. What is part of the game is the pure satisfaction of participation (fun, fitness, friendship, stress release, etc...) Without your opponent, you have no game, no contest, and no fun. You are indebted to them, as they are to you. The spirit of play, then, is based on cooperation. Upholding high standards of integrity and fair play acknowledges this idea of cooperative competition. All players are encouraged to exercise good judgment in the caring of the safety of others as well as themselves. At Cal State San Bernardino, an intentional violation of the rules is considered cheating and an offense against the spirit of competition. Abusive language toward officials, other participants, and manipulation of the rules are not 'part of the game'. A lifetime interest in sports is a goal of all players, which has more, meaning than that of a win or loss, the memory of which often fades quickly. All players are asked to participate within the context of this spirit of play and competition.

Department of Recreational Sports reserves the right to make any rule modifications and/or other changes during the course of the league whenever it deems such action necessary and proper. \"Must Slide Rule\" Teams and players are hereby notified that no such rule exists in softball, which states that a base runner \"must slide\". This has been and continues to be a standard misconception amongst a majority of softball players and fans alike. On page 65, under POINTS OF EMPHASIS IN the SCMAF rule book, it states under the section of COLLISIONS: \"It is the intent of this rule book to avoid collisions whenever possible to prevent injury. AT NO TIME DO WE INSIST OR MAKE IT MANDATORY FOR ANYONE TO SLIDE, ONLY TO AVOID INTERFERENCE WITH A FIELDER. RUNNERS SHOULD ATTEMPT TO AVOID CONTACT WHENEVER POSSIBLE. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE FOR CONTACT TO OCCUR WITHOUT INTERFERENCE. Please refer to the definitions of interference and obstruction.\" Special Rules BOTH MEN\u2019S AND COED DIVISIONS Umpires will call ALL rule infractions (as done in National Federation Softball and Baseball). This includes not legally touching a base, not tagging up, etc. There is no need for the defensive team to make appeal plays, as the umpire will automatically apply the correct penalties as soon as all play has ceased and time is out. MERCY RULE - 15 runs after 3 innings, 10 runs thereafter Since this is a self-pitch league your pitcher must get out of the way of a batted ball. If a batted ball strikes your pitcher your batter will be declared out. Automatic base on balls can be given by a defensive team requesting it at any time. One courtesy runner is allowed per inning. Courtesy runners shall be the last recorded out made by the player of the same sex. If no player of the same sex has recorded an out, the last player of the same sex listed last in the batting order shall be the courtesy runner. Teams have the option of batting any number of legally rostered players, from 8 - 16 (with unlimited defensive substitutions), with any remaining rostered players being withheld as substitutes. COMMUNICATION WITH OFFICIALS - Only the team captain/coach is allowed to have communication with the game officials. Should a certain player(s) have questions/concerns, they should be directed to the officials via the captain/coach ONLY. NOTE: The starting batting order must be followed, but defensive changes may be made at any time. Players arriving after the 1st pitch of the game may be added to the end of the batting order immediately upon arrival, or must be used as a regular substitute. The scorekeeper need not be notified of any defensive changes, but must be told of any substitution changes. Any batter failing to bat for any reason will be automatically out if no legal substitute is available the first time a batter fails to bat. Said player shall not participate any further in the game. This space shall be skipped for the remainder of the game with no further penalty. BOTH DIVISIONS: All teams will use the self-pitch rule. All batters will have a maximum of 3 pitches. If by the third pitch the batter DOES NOT get a hit he/she is out. Sides will change when there are 3 outs. COED DIVISION ONLY The 160-foot arc will not be in effect. Fielders may play anywhere defensively. Rosters must have a minimum of four women and four men to begin any game. The following are the only combinations allowed: Roster Combinations Women Men 4 4 or 5 5 4 or 5 6 4 The batting order must alternate by sex. Members of the same sex may never bat consecutively. Banned Players The Department of Recreational Sports reserves the right to ban any player, coach, spectator, or participant from further participation for an indefinite time period due to any misconduct and/or unsportsmanlike conduct. Further Information Any questions, problems, or further information on anything pertaining to the Softball program can be obtained by contacting us. Game Limits Games consist of 7 innings and/or all games will have a 1-hour time limit. Eligibility Only CURRENT students, staff, faculty, and alumni association members are eligible to participate. A student must have paid his/her fees, which include a portion that is directed toward the Department of Campus Recreation. Students in an Extended Education program or who are Open University students are not eligible to participate. The exception for this would be for the students participating in the 10 week International Student Exchange. Teams who have players on their roster who have either been a member of a collegiate team or a professional l team must get approval of Campus Recreation before the season begins. Any team with two or more current or former collegiate and or professional players on their rosters must advise the Department of Campus Recreation in advance and BEFORE the program begins. If this is not done, all games played with or without the current/former collegiate and or professional players will be considered losses. The intent of this rule is to make all other participants aware of the circumstances, and to make modifications (if necessary) for championship awards. A player may play for only one team. A player who has played on more than one team without explicit authorization will have all games they played in count as losses, including games played on for their \u201coriginal team\u201d. If any player is found ineligible for any reason all of the games that he/she has participated in will be losses. Postponed / Rained-Out Games Postponed or rained-out league games will not be re-played. POSSIBLE RAINED OUT GAMES: The following procedure will be followed in case there is any doubt concerning the condition of the fields immediately following or on a rainy day: Both the home team and visiting team captains must call the Assistant Coordinator of Recreational Sports by 12 noon on the day of the game. The playability of the field will have been determined by that time. The umpire at the field location will make any changes due to the condition of the weather AFTER the Department of Recreational Sports has made a decision. Awards Each member of the championship team will receive an Intramural Championship t-shirt. Protests Sec. 1 The notification of the intent to protest must be made immediately before the ball is put into play, or the play will no longer be protested. The captain of the protesting team should immediately notify the official(s) that the game is being continued under protest. Officials will notify the opposing team captain or manager. All interested parties shall take notice of the conditions surrounding the making of the decision that will aid in the correct determination of the issue. Protest shall be handed in writing to the Recreation Office the next working day. Failure to do so will also negate the protest. Tied Games Tied games may continue at the end of 7th inning of play only if the time limit has not expired. League games ending in a tie will count as a tie. Student Identification All participants must register their social security number on their roster and have their Coyote One card present at game time at every game. Proper identification consists of a valid Coyote One card and valid social security number. Faculty and staff should follow the same procedure, as do the students. Alumni Association members need a current membership card and a photo ID. The Department of Campus Recreation requires that all teams complete registration of their team before the beginning of the season. In cases where a participant has an extenuating circumstance (recently transferred, lost ID, etc.), they may still participate. However, the participant must complete the process before their first game. If this is not done, the participant will not be allowed to play until he/she follows the proper procedure. Scorekeeping The Department of Recreational Sports student assistants will keep the official game score. Players / Rosters ROSTER SIZE \u2013 Rosters can have an unlimited amount of players. A Coed roster must have at least 4 women and 4 men. SIGNED ROSTERS \u2013 Captains are responsible for making sure that each player signs their roster, registers his/her social security number and supplies a valid Coyote One card at game time. The captains also understand and realize that the Department of Campus Recreation DOES NOT HAVE OR PROVIDE MEDICAL INSURANCE in the event a player is injured during the course of the season. In addition, the team captain is responsible to assure that each player reads and fully understands and completes the waiver form. Any player not filling out the waiver or roster will be ineligible for that game. ADDITIONAL PLAYERS - Teams may add or delete players on their rosters until the end of the third week of the season. These changes must be made the day prior to your games. MINIMUM PLAYERS - 10 rostered players shall constitute a full team. Teams may start with 7 players, (men\u2019s only) or 8, (co-ed) and must maintain the minimum rostered players in the game at all times, otherwise a forfeit will occur. TEAM BENCH DESIGNATION: Home team will sit on the 1st base side of the field, and the visiting team will sit on the 3rd base side. Rules of Play Official softball rules as published by Southern California Municipal Athletic Federation (SCMAF), with certain exceptions as noted herein will be used during league play. Forfeits Game time is forfeit time. The definition of a forfeit is: THE PENALTY IMPOSED ON A TEAM FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO FIELD AT LEAST 7(men\u2019s) 0r 8(co-ed) ROSTERED PLAYERS ON THE FIELD AT GAME TIME. Teams forfeiting a game based on this definition will receive a loss for the forfeited game. After 2 forfeits, the team will be dropped from the program. Equipment Pants, shorts, sweats, etc. may be worn with pockets and belt loops as long as safety is not put at risk. In general, any kind of attire is acceptable to participate in as long as the safety of the individual and other participants is not put in question. Jewelry is not allowed - PERIOD! Placing tape over any type of jewelry on any part of the body (ear, nose, eyebrow, etc.) is not allowed, as the jewelry is still present, and presents a safety concern to both the player wearing the jewelry as well as the opponent. Shoes - All players must wear an enclosed shoe. Spiked shoes made out of any non-metal material may be worn. NO METAL CLEATS. Any players wearing metal cleats must remove them immediately; play must be stopped until the metal cleats are removed. Game balls and bats must be \u201cofficial\u201d. The only bats allowed to be used for all scheduled games must say on the bat \u201cofficial softball bat\u201d. Playoffs Playoffs are determined at the end of the season.

Department of Recreational Sports reserves the right to make any rule modifications and/or other changes during the course of the league whenever it deems such action n", "ecessary and proper. \"Must Slide Rule\" Teams and players are hereby notified that no such rule exists in softball, which states that a base runner \"must slide\". This has been and continues to be a standard misconception amongst a majority of softball players and fans alike. On page 65, under POINTS OF EMPHASIS IN the SCMAF rule book, it states under the section of COLLISIONS: \"It is the intent of this rule book to avoid collisions whenever possible to prevent injury. AT NO TIME DO WE INSIST OR MAKE IT MANDA", "TORY FOR ANYONE TO SLIDE, ONLY TO AVOID INTERFERENCE WITH A FIELDER. RUNNERS SHOULD ATTEMPT TO AVOID CONTACT WHENEVER POSSIBLE. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE FOR CONTACT TO OCCUR WITHOUT INTERFERENCE. Please refer to the definitions of interference and obstruction.\" Special Rules BOTH MEN\u2019S AND COED DIVISIONS Umpires will call ALL rule infractions (as done in National Federation Softball and Baseball). This includes not legally touching a base, not tagging up, etc. There is no need for the defensive team to make ", "appeal plays, as the umpire will automatically apply the correct penalties as soon as all play has ceased and time is out. MERCY RULE - 15 runs after 3 innings, 10 runs thereafter Since this is a self-pitch league your pitcher must get out of the way of a batted ball. If a batted ball strikes your pitcher your batter will be declared out. Automatic base on balls can be given by a defensive team requesting it at any time. One courtesy runner is allowed per inning. Courtesy runners shall be the last recorded ", "out made by the player of the same sex. If no player of the same sex has recorded an out, the last player of the same sex listed last in the batting order shall be the courtesy runner. Teams have the option of batting any number of legally rostered players, from 8 - 16 (with unlimited defensive substitutions), with any remaining rostered players being withheld as substitutes. COMMUNICATION WITH OFFICIALS - Only the team captain/coach is allowed to have communication with the game officials. Should a certain", " player(s) have questions/concerns, they should be directed to the officials via the captain/coach ONLY. NOTE: The starting batting order must be followed, but defensive changes may be made at any time. Players arriving after the 1st pitch of the game may be added to the end of the batting order immediately upon arrival, or must be used as a regular substitute. The scorekeeper need not be notified of any defensive changes, but must be told of any substitution changes. Any batter failing to bat for any reaso", "n will be automatically out if no legal substitute is available the first time a batter fails to bat. Said player shall not participate any further in the game. This space shall be skipped for the remainder of the game with no further penalty. BOTH DIVISIONS: All teams will use the self-pitch rule. All batters will have a maximum of 3 pitches. If by the third pitch the batter DOES NOT get a hit he/she is out. Sides will change when there are 3 outs. COED DIVISION ONLY The 160-foot arc will not be in effect.", " Fielders may play anywhere defensively. Rosters must have a minimum of four women and four men to begin any game. The following are the only combinations allowed: Roster Combinations Women Men 4 4 or 5 5 4 or 5 6 4 The batting order must alternate by sex. Members of the same sex may never bat consecutively. Banned Players The Department of Recreational Sports reserves the right to ban any player, coach, spectator, or participant from further participation for an indefinite time period due to any misconduct", " and/or unsportsmanlike conduct. Further Information Any questions, problems, or further information on anything pertaining to the Softball program can be obtained by contacting us. Game Limits Games consist of 7 innings and/or all games will have a 1-hour time limit. Eligibility Only CURRENT students, staff, faculty, and alumni association members are eligible to participate. A student must have paid his/her fees, which include a portion that is directed toward the Department of Campus Recreation. Students", " in an Extended Education program or who are Open University students are not eligible to participate. The exception for this would be for the students participating in the 10 week International Student Exchange. Teams who have players on their roster who have either been a member of a collegiate team or a professional l team must get approval of Campus Recreation before the season begins. Any team with two or more current or former collegiate and or professional players on their rosters must advise the Dep", "artment of Campus Recreation in advance and BEFORE the program begins. If this is not done, all games played with or without the current/former collegiate and or professional players will be considered losses. The intent of this rule is to make all other participants aware of the circumstances, and to make modifications (if necessary) for championship awards. A player may play for only one team. A player who has played on more than one team without explicit authorization will have all games they played in c", "ount as losses, including games played on for their \u201coriginal team\u201d. If any player is found ineligible for any reason all of the games that he/she has participated in will be losses. Postponed / Rained-Out Games Postponed or rained-out league games will not be re-played. POSSIBLE RAINED OUT GAMES: The following procedure will be followed in case there is any doubt concerning the condition of the fields immediately following or on a rainy day: Both the home team and visiting team captains must call the Assis", "tant Coordinator of Recreational Sports by 12 noon on the day of the game. The playability of the field will have been determined by that time. The umpire at the field location will make any changes due to the condition of the weather AFTER the Department of Recreational Sports has made a decision. Awards Each member of the championship team will receive an Intramural Championship t-shirt. Protests Sec. 1 The notification of the intent to protest must be made immediately before the ball is put into play, or", " the play will no longer be protested. The captain of the protesting team should immediately notify the official(s) that the game is being continued under protest. Officials will notify the opposing team captain or manager. All interested parties shall take notice of the conditions surrounding the making of the decision that will aid in the correct determination of the issue. Protest shall be handed in writing to the Recreation Office the next working day. Failure to do so will also negate the protest. Tied", " Games Tied games may continue at the end of 7th inning of play only if the time limit has not expired. League games ending in a tie will count as a tie. Student Identification All participants must register their social security number on their roster and have their Coyote One card present at game time at every game. Proper identification consists of a valid Coyote One card and valid social security number. Faculty and staff should follow the same procedure, as do the students. Alumni Association members n", "eed a current membership card and a photo ID. The Department of Campus Recreation requires that all teams complete registration of their team before the beginning of the season. In cases where a participant has an extenuating circumstance (recently transferred, lost ID, etc.), they may still participate. However, the participant must complete the process before their first game. If this is not done, the participant will not be allowed to play until he/she follows the proper procedure. Scorekeeping The Depar", "tment of Recreational Sports student assistants will keep the official game score. Players / Rosters ROSTER SIZE \u2013 Rosters can have an unlimited amount of players. A Coed roster must have at least 4 women and 4 men. SIGNED ROSTERS \u2013 Captains are responsible for making sure that each player signs their roster, registers his/her social security number and supplies a valid Coyote One card at game time. The captains also understand and realize that the Department of Campus Recreation DOES NOT HAVE OR PROVIDE ME", "DICAL INSURANCE in the event a player is injured during the course of the season. In addition, the team captain is responsible to assure that each player reads and fully understands and completes the waiver form. Any player not filling out the waiver or roster will be ineligible for that game. ADDITIONAL PLAYERS - Teams may add or delete players on their rosters until the end of the third week of the season. These changes must be made the day prior to your games. MINIMUM PLAYERS - 10 rostered players shall ", "constitute a full team. Teams may start with 7 players, (men\u2019s only) or 8, (co-ed) and must maintain the minimum rostered players in the game at all times, otherwise a forfeit will occur. TEAM BENCH DESIGNATION: Home team will sit on the 1st base side of the field, and the visiting team will sit on the 3rd base side. Rules of Play Official softball rules as published by Southern California Municipal Athletic Federation (SCMAF), with certain exceptions as noted herein will be used during league play.

The definition of a forfeit is: THE PENALTY IMPOSED ON A TEAM FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO FIELD AT LEAST 7(men\u2019s) 0r 8(co-ed) ROSTERED PLAYERS ON THE FIELD AT GAME TIME.

Recreational Sports reserves the right to make rule modifications and/or other changes during the course of the league whenever it deems such action necessary and proper. Mercy Rule If a team is behind by 30 points at any portion of the game, the game will be terminated. Length of Game Games consist of two 20-minute halves with a 3-minute half time. The clock runs continuously until the final two minutes of the second half. Designated Bench Zone/Bench Clearing ALL players must remain in their designated box at all times (from the 20-yd line to the 20-yd line). If a team is caught outside of this area, a 5yard penalty may be assessed. Participants may only leave their bench / designated boxed area in the following instances: To enter a game At the conclusion of the game Playoffs Playoffs will be determined by various factors, including, but not limited to: number of rainouts, availability of teams to compete, and field availability. Teams with winning records will be eligible to play in the playoffs. Eligibility Only CURRENT students, staff, faculty, and alumni association members are eligible to participate. A student must have paid his/her fees, which include a portion that is directed toward the Department of Recreational Sports. A player may play for only one team per league/per day. A player who has played on more than one team without explicit authorization will have all games they played in count as losses, including games played on for their \"original team\". If any player is found ineligible for any reason all of the games that he/she has participated in will count as losses. Teams who have players on their roster who have either been a member of a collegiate team or a professional team must get approval of Recreational Sports before the season begins. Any team with two or more current or former collegiate and/or professional players, of the sport being played, on their rosters must advise the Department of Recreational Sports in advance and before the program begins. If this is not done, all games played with or without the current/former collegiate and or professional players will be considered losses. The intent of this rule is to make all other participants aware of the circumstances, and to make modifications (if necessary) for championship awards. Identification Every participant (faculty, staff and students) must provide evidence that they are members or have paid for a day pass. All participants will be required to go to the gym and receive a wristband after passing through the turnstiles before their games. In an effort to simplify and make participation more accessible to all, the Intramural department of Recreational Sports requests that all team captains completes their rosters for each sport they are participating in (Names and Student ID number for each player) before the first week of contests. All players must also fill out a waiver form before they are allowed to play. Penalties 5-yd: too many players on the field, offsides, delay of game, player with possession that dives, wearing jewelry 10-yd: holding (spot of foul), down field blocking, flag guarding, tackling, offensive pass interference, hurdling 15-yd: unnecessary roughness (possible ejection), unsportsmanlike conduct, defensive pass interference, and flag tampering Loss of down: intentional grounding, illegal forward pass, and offensive pass interference Automatic first down: defensive pass interference, roughing the passer Number of Players Each team must consist of seven players. If a team does not have seven players, they may start with six. Rain-out Game Procedure In the case of inclement weather jeopardizing game day both the home team and visiting team captains call the Recreation Center office by 12 noon on game day. The condition of the field will have been determined by that time. Equipment Pants, shorts and sweat pants without pockets may be worn without belts and belt loops. All players must wear a shirt. Shirts must be tucked in so flag belts are visible at all times. Jewelry is not allowed - PERIOD! Placing tape over any type of jewelry on any part of the body is not allowed, as the jewelry is still present, and presents a safety concern to both the player wearing the jewelry as well as the opponent. The game will not begin until all jewelry is removed. (If not removed before game time it will result in a 5 yard penalty) All players must wear a closed toe athletic shoe. Cleats may be worn, cleats must be made of non-metal material and not exceed 1/2 inch in length. Hats are NOT permitted due to safety reasons. Rules of Play All play will be based on the NIRSA Flag Football Rules, with certain exceptions, as noted herein. Protests Sec. 1 The notification of the intent to protest must be made immediately before the ball is put into play, (the next snap from Scrimmage) or the play will no longer be protested. The captain of the protesting team should immediately notify the official(s) that the game is being continued under protest. Officials will notify the opposing team captain or manager. All interested parties shall take notice of the conditions surrounding the making of the decision that will aid in the correct determination of the issue. Protest shall be handed in writing to the Recreation Office the next working day. Failure to do so will also negate the protest. Time Outs / Clock Two 1-minute time outs per team per half and are not cumulative. The clock will stop for: Team time outs. Official's time out (time starts on the whistle of the official). Injuries necessitating time to remove a player from the field. During the last two minutes of the second half. Signed Waivers / Medical Insurance Captains are responsible for making sure that each player signing the WAIVER FORMS understands and realizes that the Department of Recreational Sports DOES NOT PROVIDE insurance. In the event, a player is injured during the course of the season; he/she should have his/her own insurance. Fumbles / Dead Ball / Interceptions A ball is dead when: removal of a flag, out of bounds, a safety, a touchdown and ALL FUMBLES. A live ball that hits the ground on any play is a DEAD BALL. Any fumble occurring down field or past the line of scrimmage is dead where the player loses possession. Any fumble behind the line of scrimmage or on the snap the ball is dead where it lands and may not be advanced. If the ball lands in the end zone, it is a safety. When a pass, that is intercepted and is fumbled the ball remains with the intercepting team and is spotted where the player lost possession. Interceptions may be returned if caught in the end zone. Also a defending team may intercept and return a 1 & 2 point conversion. The score would be the exact point value of the conversion try. Players / Roster Size Players may only play for one team during the season. Once a player has played on a team, they must play for that team the entire season. Rosters are required to be submitted into the Department of Recreational Sports by the Captains meeting. Teams may add players to their rosters up until the 3rd week of the season. ALL players must remain in their designated box at all times (from the 20-yd line to the 20-yd line). Scoring Touchdown = 6 points Point after = 1 point (from the 5 yard line run or pass) Point after = 2 points (from the 10 yard line run or pass) Safety = 2 points Alcohol / Food / Drinks / Tobacco Alcohol and tobacco products are prohibited for consumption or any other use by any participant on a flag football team. All players and participants are asked not to use any glass containers and to assist in keeping the fields and surrounding area clean by cleaning up after themselves. Any player(s) under the influence will be ejected. Punting The team that chooses to punt must announce their choice and the defensive team must have five players on the line of scrimmage. These five players may not cross the line of scrimmage. If the ball hits the ground during game time, it is dead. The punt may be returned so long as the receiver does not muff the ball or, the ball hits the ground first. In both cases the ball will be dead at the spot. * (Note that a team may throw the ball instead of kicking it during the punt) Flag Belt Removal Offensive players must have possession of the ball before they can legally be de-flagged. Instances where a flag belt has been removed prior to the player advancing the ball, the ball carriers progress can be stopped by a two- handed tag between the shoulders and knees. A flag belt, which becomes detached unintentionally, does not cause play to stop. Circumstances where a flag belt is removed illegally, play will continue with the option of the penalty (12 yards) or the result of the play. Tampering with the flag belt in any way including tying, using foreign materials, etc., will result in a 15-yard penalty from the Line of Scrimmage, loss of down, and player ejection. Forfeit Fees All teams that fail to show up for their games automatically forfeit the game. Teams that do not inform the Intramural department at least one full day before their game that they are unable to attend will be assessed a forfeit fee. Teams will not be allowed to play in the league until that fee has been paid. Two forfeits from a team regardless if they are consecutive or not will result in that team being removed from the league. Touchdown Verification A player scoring a touchdown must immediately approach the official so the official can verify the flag belt is \"legal\". The official will pull the player's flag with one pull. If the flag cannot be removed and the official determines the flag belt has been illegally secured, the touchdown will be negated. The player will be ejected; a 15-yard penalty will be assessed from the previous line of scrimmage and a loss of down. Field of Play The winner of the coin toss will have the choice of possession or direction. Punts (thrown or kicked) that go out of the end zone will be placed on the 20-yard line. Punts that are fumbled are dead balls. The center may snap the ball through his/her legs or stand beside the ball to snap it. There must be a minimum of three players on the offensive line during each play before the snap. All players are eligible to receive a pass. There will be a 30 second play clock once the official spots the ball (places it on the ground). A player with possession of the ball may NOT leave his/her feet for any reason to advance the ball (diving or hurdling). The ball may be lateraled at anytime. If an official blows his/her whistle inadvertently the play is DEAD and the down will be replayed or the team may take the result of the play. Blocking / Contact Offensive lineman must SCREEN defenders. Screening is done by placing your hands and arms either at your side or behind your back. Lineman can never pass the line of scrimmage to screen. All linemen screening must occur behind the line of scrimmage. NO DOWN FIELD SCREENING is permitted. Ball carriers may not run over or through defensive players. The defensive lineman must run around offensive lineman, NOT through them. Ties Any games that are tied at the end of regulation will have an \"overtime\" that consists of: Each team has FOUR offensive plays from the 20-yd line to score one touchdown and a 1 or 2 point conversion. An interception cannot be returned for a touchdown; possession goes to the intercepting team. If no one scores within the four plays of overtime, the game will remain a tie. Playoffs only, if no one scores after overtime, then each team will continue the overtime format from the 10-yd line until a winner is declared.

The California State University, San Bernardino Department of Recreational Sports reserves the right to make any rule modifications and/or other changes during the course of the league whenever it deems such action necessary and proper. Dunking Dunking will be allowed during this program. Any player deliberately hanging on the rim for no reason after a dunk will be assessed a technical foul . Should any rims or the fiberglass backboards be damaged because of malicious hanging on the rims, the Department of Recreational Sports will hold the guilty person financially responsible for total replacement of the damaged equipment, as well as administrative costs associated in rescheduling games, officials, etc. Also, based on the Student Discipline Code, any damage caused by maliciousness could result in the expulsion, suspension, and/or probation of the student involved. Running Clock/Regulation Clock The clock runs at all times EXCEPT: During time outs. During an injury. Last 2 minutes of the 2nd half whenever the point difference 10 or less. During Technical fouls A regulation clock will be in effect during the last 2 minutes of the 2nd half, only if the difference in the score is 10 points or less. In cases where the difference in the score is 11 or more points, the clock will continue to run until the difference in points is 10 or less, at which time, regulation clock will be in effect. A regulation clock will be in effect during any overtime period(s). Eligibility Only CURRENT students, staff, faculty, and alumni association members are eligible to participate. A student must have paid his/her fees, which include a portion that is directed toward the Department of Recreational Sports. A player may play for only one team per league/per day. A player who has played on more than one team without explicit authorization will have all games they played in count as losses, including games played on for their \"original team\". If any player is found ineligible for any reason all of the games that he/she has participated in will count as losses. Teams who have players on their roster who have either been a member of a collegiate team or a professional team must get approval of Recreational Sports before the season begins. Any team with two or more current or former collegiate and/or professional players, of the sport being played, on their rosters must advise the Department of Recreational Sports in advance and before the program begins. If this is not done, all games played with or without the current/former collegiate and or professional players will be considered losses. The intent of this rule is to make all other participants aware of the circumstances, and to make modifications (if necessary) for championship awards. Players/Rosters ROSTER SIZE - Rosters with an unlimited amount of players are required to be submitted to the Department of Recreational Sports no later than the captains meeting. Unless prior arrangements were made with the Coordinator. SIGNED ROSTERS - Captains are responsible for making sure that each player signs their roster, registers his/her student identification number and has been given a wristband from the SRFC after verifying membership. The captains also understand and realize that the Department of Recreational Sports DOES NOT HAVE OR PROVIDE MEDICAL INSURANCE in the event a player is injured during the course of the season. ADDITIONAL PLAYERS - Teams may add or delete players on their rosters until the end of the third week of the season. These changes must be made the day prior to your games. MINIMUM PLAYERS - Five rostered players shall constitute a full team. Teams may start with 4 players. CHAMPIONSHIP AWARDS - Although we allow an unlimited amount of people on your rosters we will only give out 10 awards for the championship team. Tied Games If the score is tied at the end of regulation time, a 2-minute overtime period will be played. Regulation clock will be in effect for the duration of the overtime period. If the score remains tied at the end of the first overtime period, a second overtime period will be in effect. The duration of the second overtime will be 1 minute. If there is still no winner a tie will be declared. Playoff games will continue until there is a winner. Forfeits All teams that fail to show up for their games automatically forfeit the game. Teams that do not inform the Intramural department at least one full day before their game that they are unable to attend will be assessed a forfeit fee. Teams will not be allowed to play in the league until that fee has been paid. Two forfeits from a team regardless if they are consecutive or not will result in that team being removed from the league. Scorekeeping The Department of Recreational Sports will keep the score and game clock. Time violations The following are time limits you have: 3 seconds when on offense and in the lane 5 seconds to inbound a ball 10 seconds to advance the ball past the half court line Rules of Play All play will be based on the NIRSA Basketball Rules, with certain exceptions, as noted herein. Special Rules BONUS SITUATION - The bonus situation (1 + 1) will be in effect on the 7th team foul. The Double Bonus is in effect on the 10th team foul (automatically 2 free shots) FOULING OUT - after 5 personal fouls the player \"fouls out\" and must remain on the bench. LANGUAGE \u2013 If person(s) affiliated with team(s) use abusive or foul language before, during or after a contest the team/individual will receive one warning. If the language does not cease the individual will be suspended from play until the Department of Campus Recreation deems necessary. COMMUNICATION WITH OFFICIALS - Only the team captain/coach is allowed to have communication with the game officials. Should a certain player(s) have questions/concerns, they should be directed to the officials via the captain/coach ONLY. TECHNICAL FOULS - In addition for reasons for officials to call technical fouls as listed in the CIF Rulebook, technical fouls will be assessed for: Arguing with referees or instructing/assisting referees with calls Expectorating (spitting anywhere on or in the basketball area) Interrupting the flow of the game Unsportsmanlike conduct Non-conformance with the rules. Two technical fouls within the same game (coaches / players) will result in ejection. Any coach or player accumulating 2 technical foul ejections within a season will be reevaluated to determine their suitability for their continued participation in this program. Coaches are permitted to walk/stand while the game is in progress as long as he/she does not inhibit the referee(s). ANY player, placed within the free throw area, may begin positioning for a rebound once the ball leaves the shooters hand. Equipment NO shorts or pants with pockets allowed and NO belt loops. Jewelry is not allowed - PERIOD! Placing tape over any type of jewelry on any part of the body is not allowed, as the jewelry is still present, and presents a safety concern to both the player wearing the jewelry as well as the opponent. The game will not begin until all jewelry is removed. Shoes - All players must wear an enclosed non-marring sneaker. A shoe that mars floors or leave marks may not be worn. The Department of Recreational Sports will provide the game ball for all scheduled games. Should both teams involved in a given game have another ball, which both teams mutually agree to use instead of the one provided, it may be used. Further Information Any questions, problems, or further information on anything pertaining to the Intramural Basketball season can be obtained Banned Players The Department of Recreational Sports reserves the right to ban any player, coach, spectator, or participant from further participation for an indefinite time period due to any misconduct and/or unsportsmanlike conduct. Mercy Rule Whenever the difference in the score is 30 points, the game will be terminated, regardless of the amount of time played. Changes to League Schedule Every effort will be made on the part of the Department of Recreational Sports to accommodate special needs PRIOR to the beginning of the season. All teams are advised that once the season begins, changes to the league schedule will not be changed to accommodate teams who may have certain players who cannot participate due to personal work schedules, prior engagements, or other games. Protests Sec. 1 The notification of the intent to protest must be made before the ball is put back into play, or the play will no longer be protestable. The captain of the protesting team should immediately notify the official(s) that the game is being continued under protest. Officials will notify the opposing team captain or manager. All interested parties shall take notice of the conditions surrounding the making of the decision that will aid in the correct determination of the issue. Protest shall be handed in writing to the Recreation Office the next working day by 5 p.m. Failure to do so will also negate the protest. Food/Drinks No food or drinks are allowed inside the gym and spectator area (bleachers). This includes player's sipper bottles, water, etc. Spectators *Spectators and Equipment Team captain(s) are responsible for his/her own spectators, fans, and equipment. Spectators are subject to the policies and regulations of the Recreational Sports. Game Limits Games consist of two 20-minute halves. The first half is a RUNNING CLOCK the second half is a RUNNING CLOCK with the final two minutes being kept as REGULATION CLOCK during the last 2 minutes of the second half. TIME OUTS - Each team is allowed 3-one minute time outs per regulation game (cumulative). In the event of an overtime period, each team is issued a single one-minute time out for each overtime period. There will be a 5-minute time break between halves. Game time is forfeit time, as kept by the official/scorekeeper's watch. Student Identification Every participant (faculty, staff and students) must provide evidence that they are members or have paid for a day pass. All participants will be required to go to the gym and receive a wristband after passing through the turnstiles before their games. In an effort to simplify and make participation more accessible to all, the Intramural department of Recreational Sports requests that all team captains completes their rosters for each sport they are participating in (Names and Student ID number for each player) before the first week of contests. All players must also fill out a waiver form before they are allowed to play.

View More Events Announcements Check It Out! We have a new Climbing Route Guide to help you find what's new and the route that matches your ability. About Us One of the highlights of the Student Recreation and Wellness Center is a 34' high, 1,000 square foot climbing wall, which is open to all CSUSB students and SRWC members. A comprehensive selection of climbing programs and classes. A great environment for climbers of all experience levels to train and improve their skills. Free harness, hardware, shoes and chalk bag usage. Climbing Programs Climbing Route Guide Find out what's new and what routes match your ability. Bouldering A fun and challenging traverse across the wall or just part way up the wall instead of ascending the whole wall. Boulder is done short distances from the ground and does not require a belay but may require spotting. Bouldering is a great way to work on your technique. Bouldering is available anytime the SRWC is open to those that are trained and bouldering approved. Just check in with the membership desk and get a wrist band. Open during SRWC operation hours.

Whether you are an experienced athlete or just looking to learn a new sport, we are dedicated to providing our participants enjoyable, innovative and safe activities for all skill levels and interests. Get a team together or join one as a free agent and compete against other CSUSB teams in your favorite sport. Intramural sports are free to all currently enrolled students. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions. CSUSB Intramural Sports believes in the Spirit Of Comptition Sport activities find their origin in the basic human need for the spirit of play. Winning and losing are mere outcomes of this play spirit. What is part of the game is the pure satisfaction of participation (fun, fitness, friendship, stress release, etc...) Without your opponent, you have no game, no contest, and no fun. You are indebted to them, as they are to you. The spirit of play, then, is based on cooperation. Upholding high standards of integrity and fair play acknowledges this idea of cooperative competition. All players are encouraged to exercise good judgment in the caring of the safety of others as well as themselves. At Cal State San Bernardino, an intentional violation of the rules is considered cheating and an offense against the spirit of competition. Abusive language toward officials, other participants, and manipulation of the rules are not 'part of the game'. A lifetime interest in sports is a goal of all players, which has more, meaning than that of a win or loss, the memory of which often fades quickly. All players are asked to participate within the context of this spirit of play and competition.

Our Mission The mission of the Recreational & Wellness Department is to provide a variety of safe and enjoyable programs and facilities to meet the diverse needs of the CSUSB community by creating a healthy social environment, enriching the quality of life and enhancing the educational experience. The Department of Recreational & Wellness is committed to the missions of the university and the Division of Student Affairs. Department staff work to provide opportunities for personal and professional development through Adventure Programs, Aquatics, Intramurals, Sport Clubs, Fitness & Wellness programs, Special Events, and open recreation. The Recreation & Wellness Department is proud to offer the CSUSB Community a wide range of activities and programs to enhance physical fitness, learn new skills, engage in friendly sports competition, expand one\u2019s knowledge base / comfort level, relieve stress, and to simply have fun! We welcome all enrolled CSUSB students, staff, faculty, and alumni regardless of age, gender, experience, and ability. Executive Summary The desire for the Student Recreation & Wellness Center (SRWC) at Cal State San Bernardino grew out of the need for a state-of-the-art facility to increase student\u2019s health and fitness levels, develop a sense of community, as well as assist with the recruitment and retention of students. CSUSB students championed this project by voting to increase their fees to fund the building\u2019s construction and operation. The facility has exceeded student and administrator expectations with its high-end, durable finishes, and open & inviting design. The campus continually raves about the facility and daily usage has increased by over 500 percent since its opening in 2010. Due to the success of the SRWC, a facility expansion is in the campus master plan in the near future. The SRWC features a large fitness floor with cardio machines, weight equipment & functional training space, two multi-purpose studios, a multi-purpose gymnasium, and a climbing/bouldering wall featuring an auto belay, as well as saunas, locker rooms, administrative offices, equipment rental, and laundry facilities. The first challenge of the project was site selection. The committee charged with the center\u2019s development chose to place the SRWC in the existing footprint of old tennis courts, nestled into a stand of pine trees and adjacent to an existing parking lot, thus saving space, time and money. The site is also close to the existing playing fields and other athletic facilities, fitting into the campus master plan. In order to maximize flexibility and minimize structural impacts, the building was designed with clear span glu-laminated wood beams and a deep span metal deck structural system, reducing capital expenditures. Additionally, a lively social setting was created with a \u2018gallery\u2019 circulation space accentuated by durable, but elegant end block wood flooring. This gallery links the various functions of the building, providing a visual, as well as physical, connection between all public areas. It also allows staff to easily supervise activity areas. Aesthetic exterior and interior finishes: The shape and materials of the building were designed to fit easily into the natural environment of the San Bernardino campus, as well as with other campus buildings. The high ceiling and abundant natural light of the main lobby invites users to enter an open, airy facility. Generous sight lines remove physical and psychological barriers between spaces. The climbing wall and cardio space look at each other and create a sense of community under the eaves of the wood beams. The reception area is wide enough to accommodate a large group entering and exiting at the same time through a main control point. The architect for the SRWC was HOK, with HOK Sport as master planner. Based on their baseline sustainable design tenets and CSUSB\u2019s desire for sustainability, the following steps were taken in building the center: The site and placement of the building were chosen specifically to be responsive to climate and the natural environment (no trees were removed). Selection of building materials was considered for high functionality and low maintenance over the life span of the building. The major glass areas were designed with \u201cfritted\u201d glass \u2013 a sand blasting technique that deflects sunlight rather than allowing it to penetrate the curtain wall. This provides assistance in cooling the rooms, while allowing daylight to last well into evening. Wherever possible, environmentally preferred product selection was thoroughly researched and utilized. Staff and participant recycling is actively encouraged. Energy efficient design using occupancy sensors, day lighting, fluorescent and LED lighting, and a sophisticated building management system, allows the building to be operated with less energy usage. Students continue to be in awe of the various features in the facility. The student newspaper described it well in calling it \u201cHigh Tech Rec.\u201d The following technological features enhance the facility design and increase the operational efficiency and service to participants. Biometric hand readers are integrated with membership software system and turnstiles. This is convenient for members as they do not have to bring a membership card to use the facility, creating a need for less staff at the entry. The computerized Smart Carte locker system automatically checks out complimentary day lockers to members. Preva system provides music videos to the 14 televisions and 21 personal viewing screens, as well as the audio to the building. This system allows scrolling text advertisements across the bottom of the videos and graphic advertising on a CSUSB Recreational & Wellness page. It provides an innovative way for the department to promote its programs, while cutting down on print media. OnSite maintenance program immediately notifies staff by e-mail if a cardio machine breaks down or we have reached peak capacity on a particular type of equipment. A scoreboard with full color message center improves our communication with participants. The Recreation & Wellness Department is proud of the inviting, attractive features of the SRWC, and the positive feedback from the students, campus community, and recreation colleagues. The building is well designed, with components that complement and enhance each other, creating the statement of a structure larger than the actual footprint. This project successfully accomplished its goal of a functional recreation space, with a warm and inviting feel, while incorporating advances in technology and sustainable decision-making. The objectives of the planning committee were to develop a sense of pride and community on campus, increase student involvement, and enhance the educational mission of the University. This building and its users are meeting those goals every day. The SRWC distinguishes itself on being on the cutting edge of recreation centers that is recognized for its many merits and positive impact on the student body.

The campus continually raves about the facility and daily usage has increased by over 500 percent since its opening in 20", "10. Due to the success of the SRWC, a facility expansion is in the campus master plan in the near future. The SRWC features a large fitness floor with cardio machines, weight equipment & functional training space, two multi-purpose studios, a multi-purpose gymnasium, and a climbing/bouldering wall featuring an auto belay, as well as saunas, locker rooms, administrative offices, equipment rental, and laundry facilities. The first challenge of the project was site selection. The committee charged with the cen", "ter\u2019s development chose to place the SRWC in the existing footprint of old tennis courts, nestled into a stand of pine trees and adjacent to an existing parking lot, thus saving space, time and money. The site is also close to the existing playing fields and other athletic facilities, fitting into the campus master plan. In order to maximize flexibility and minimize structural impacts, the building was designed with clear span glu-laminated wood beams and a deep span metal deck structural system, reducing c", "apital expenditures. Additionally, a lively social setting was created with a \u2018gallery\u2019 circulation space accentuated by durable, but elegant end block wood flooring. This gallery links the various functions of the building, providing a visual, as well as physical, connection between all public areas. It also allows staff to easily supervise activity areas. Aesthetic exterior and interior finishes: The shape and materials of the building were designed to fit easily into the natural environment of the San Be", "rnardino campus, as well as with other campus buildings. The high ceiling and abundant natural light of the main lobby invites users to enter an open, airy facility. Generous sight lines remove physical and psychological barriers between spaces. The climbing wall and cardio space look at each other and create a sense of community under the eaves of the wood beams. The reception area is wide enough to accommodate a large group entering and exiting at the same time through a main control point. The architect ", "for the SRWC was HOK, with HOK Sport as master planner. Based on their baseline sustainable design tenets and CSUSB\u2019s desire for sustainability, the following steps were taken in building the center: The site and placement of the building were chosen specifically to be responsive to climate and the natural environment (no trees were removed). Selection of building materials was considered for high functionality and low maintenance over the life span of the building. The major glass areas were designed with ", "\u201cfritted\u201d glass \u2013 a sand blasting technique that deflects sunlight rather than allowing it to penetrate the curtain wall. This provides assistance in cooling the rooms, while allowing daylight to last well into evening. Wherever possible, environmentally preferred product selection was thoroughly researched and utilized. Staff and participant recycling is actively encouraged. Energy efficient design using occupancy sensors, day lighting, fluorescent and LED lighting, and a sophisticated building management ", "system, allows the building to be operated with less energy usage. Students continue to be in awe of the various features in the facility. The student newspaper described it well in calling it \u201cHigh Tech Rec.\u201d The following technological features enhance the facility design and increase the operational efficiency and service to participants. Biometric hand readers are integrated with membership software system and turnstiles. This is convenient for members as they do not have to bring a membership card to u", "se the facility, creating a need for less staff at the entry. The computerized Smart Carte locker system automatically checks out complimentary day lockers to members. Preva system provides music videos to the 14 televisions and 21 personal viewing screens, as well as the audio to the building. This system allows scrolling text advertisements across the bottom of the videos and graphic advertising on a CSUSB Recreational & Wellness page. It provides an innovative way for the department to promote its progra", "ms, while cutting down on print media. OnSite maintenance program immediately notifies staff by e-mail if a cardio machine breaks down or we have reached peak capacity on a particular type of equipment. A scoreboard with full color message center improves our communication with participants. The Recreation & Wellness Department is proud of the inviting, attractive features of the SRWC, and the positive feedback from the students, campus community, and recreation colleagues. The building is well designed, wi", "th components that complement and enhance each other, creating the statement of a structure larger than the actual footprint. This project successfully accomplished its goal of a functional recreation space, with a warm and inviting feel, while incorporating advances in technology and sustainable decision-making. The objectives of the planning committee were to develop a sense of pride and community on campus, increase student involvement, and enhance the educational mission of the University. This building", " and its users are meeting those goals every day. The SRWC distinguishes itself on being on the cutting edge of recreation centers that is recognized for its many merits and positive impact on the student body.

Your program may consist of the following components. Warm-ups - These activities are designed for people to get to know each other in a different light. Participants begin to set aside fear of embarrassment and establish a safe learning environment. Initiatives - Teams are presented challenges that requires the entire group to work together in order to arrive at a solution. The focus is on communication, support and problem solving. Low Initiative - These activities involve physical and mental challenges conducted low to the ground. They take group effort to accomplish. The group creates the safety system, spotting and supporting one another. High Individual or Team Challenges - Some of our programs include events on our TEAMS or Dynamic Course which is built in poles from 15 to 45 feet above the ground. Participants are encouraged to step beyond their comfort zone and attempt, rather than complete, the element. The TEAMS course allows teams of two to eight people work together to support each other in problem-solving. The DYNAMIC course is perfect for larger group and teams working on setting personal goals. Whether climbing a wall, riding the zip line or walking the catwalk, these elements deliver the impression of risk, though they are built to be as safe as any activity on the ground. Rates (per person) 2.5 hour Program (includes warm-ups, initiatives and Low elements Only) 4 hour Program (includes the above plus, one level of the TEAMS Course or 2-3 Dynamic Elements ) 6 - 7 hour Program (includes all the above, plus both levels of the TEAMS course or 4-6 Dynamic Elements and up to 1 hour break for lunch or dinner, not provided) Leadership Challenge Center Rates User Category 2.5 Hour 4 Hour 6 - 7 Hour CSUSB Student $ 8.00 pp $ 15.00 pp $ 20.00 pp CSUSB Faculty, Staff, Alumni Association Member $ 15.00 pp $ 29.00 pp $ 42.00 pp Non-profit* $ 22.00 pp $ 36.00 pp $ 49.00 pp Not Affiliated with CSUSB $ 30.00 pp $ 49.00 pp $ 62.00 pp * as defined by the IRS (School Groups, Scouts, Government Orgs.

The California State University, San Bernardino Department of Recreational Sports reserves the right to make rule modifications and/or other changes during the course of the league whenever it deems such action necessary and proper. Playoffs Teams with a winning record any winning record will qualify for playoffs. Teams will be determined at the discretion of the commissioner. All decisions are final. **Again, any rules not specifically addressed will be interpreted along the lines of NCAA outdoor rules and common sense. General Rules of Play Generally, the rules of NCAA outdoor soccer will be used to govern indoor soccer. Still, there will be a number of modifications: There is no offsides in indoor soccer. There is no slide-tackling allowed. To do so results in an indirect free kick at the spot of the violation, a yellow card and a two minute penalty. Defensive players must stand at least 4 yards from the ball during any free kick. On the kickoff to start the game or after a goal, the defending team must be behind the half court line for basketball. Penalty kicks will be taken from the top of the goalie's box (about 8 yards away). All players other than the kicker and the goalie must be behind the mid-court line when the penalty kick is taken. If the goalie handles the ball in any way, a goal kicks and free kicks or throws by the goalie must touch the floor or be touched by a player before reaching mid-court. If a ball travels over mid-court in the air on a goal kick or goalie throw, the ball will be put in play by the non-offending team by an indirect free kick at mid-court. Rough play (fouls) will be characterized as flagrant and non-flagrant. A flagrant foul will be penalized by a two-minute penalty, as in ice hockey. Violent intentional violations such as pushing, tripping, etc. will bring about this penalty. After a penalty, play resumes with a direct free kick at the spot of the foul. Continual rough play by and individual will result in a game ejection and possible suspension from the league. Non-flagrant fouls will bring about a direct free kick at the point of the violation only. Any problems or questions which arise during a game will be dealt with by the official. One official will be present for all games and their decisions are final. Equipment Intramurals will provide two soccer balls, pennies (to be worn by one of the teams), and goals. No cleats or block-soled shoes may be worn. Length of Games / Timing Games consist of two, 20-minute halves. There will be a five-minute halftime. Games will start on the hour. There will be time for warming up prior to the first game and for 5-10 minutes of warm-up prior to each successive game*(with the exceptions of incidents happening). Games use running time throughout. The clock will be stopped only for injuries or for other extraordinary reasons as the official deems necessary. Goals do not stop the clock. There is no waiting period the game clock starts on the hour. Number of Players / Substitutions There will only be a maximum of 4 players in play during a match (includes the Goalie). Goalie substitutions have to be notified and can only occur on a dead ball.

The court will be at least 50 ft long and at least 30 ft wide. Match Play Matches will be decided using a \u201c best-of-nine\u201d format in which the first team to win five (5) games will be declared the winner. The Team A team roster may have a maximum of 12 players on it. A minimum of 6 players is necessary to compete. The game begins with six players on either team and no one may substitute into a game after it has already started. Others will be available as substitutes. Substitutes may enter the game only in the case of injury. Delays The official is given sole discretion in matters of delays. The two types of delays are: Holding the dodgeball for any amount of time greater than what is needed to complete a play. Remaining out of bounds for more time or taking more time than is necessary to retrieve a ball that has gone out of bounds. The official may warn or call a player \u201c Out \u201c based, solely, on their discretion for violation of the delay rules. Boundaries During play, all players must remain within the boundary lines. Stepping on the line is considered \u201cOut\u201d. The midline will be treated like any other boundary line. The midline extends infinitely, and players may not cross it even when retrieving a ball that is out of bounds. There will be an entry and exit point on each side of each end of the court. Players must enter and exit through this point in order to retrieve dodgeballs that are out of bounds. A player who is retrieving a ball, outside the boundaries is not a legal target Any player who is outside the boundary lines cannot play a ball. The Team Bench area and \u201c Out Zone\u201d (Where players are sent after being called out) are also considered boundary lines. Any player inside one of these areas, who steps on the line or outside of the area, will be penalized. Penalty: Closest player to the infraction will be called out. The back wall is considered out. Once a ball hits the wall, that ball is treated as if it has hit the ground. Time-Outs & Substitutions There will be no time outs during games. Teams may only substitute in between games and in case of injury The Game The object of the game is to eliminate all opposing players by getting them \u201cOUT\u201d. This may be done by: Hitting an opposing player with a thrown ball on or below the shoulders. (A player who intentionally gets hit in the head is also considered \u201cOUT\u201d) Catching a ball Thrown by your opponent before it touches the ground. If a player is knocked out but has already thrown a ball, that ball is live. A deflected ball can be caught, in which case the player who was hit is not OUT and the player who threw the ball is. The Game begins by placing six dodgeballs along the centerline. Players then take a position behind their end line. Following a signal by the official, teams may approach the centerline to retrieve the balls. This signal officially starts the contest. Once a ball is retrieved, it must be possessed by a player who has one foot established on or behind the 3 meter line before that ball can be thrown.\u2019 The first team to legally eliminate all opposing players will be declared the winner. The Equipment The official ball used in the tournament and league play will be a 7\u201d rhino-skin foam ball. Participants must wear shoes. No black-soled shoes are allowed.

The California State University, San Bernardino Department of Recreational Sports reserves the right to make rule modifications and/or other changes during the course of the league whenever it deems such action necessary and proper. Playoffs Teams with a winning record any winning record will qualify for playoffs. Teams will be determined at the discretion of the commissioner. All decisions are final. **Again, any rules not specifically addressed will be interpreted along the lines of NCAA outdoor rules and common sense. General Rules of Play Generally, the rules of NCAA outdoor soccer will be used to govern indoor soccer. Still, there will be a number of modifications: There is no offsides in indoor soccer. There is no slide-tackling allowed. To do so results in an indirect free kick at the spot of the violation, a yellow card and a two minute penalty. Defensive players must stand at least 4 yards from the ball during any free kick. On the kickoff to start the game or after a goal, the defending team must be behind the half court line for basketball. Penalty kicks will be taken from the top of the goalie's box (about 8 yards away). All players other than the kicker and the goalie must be behind the mid-court line when the penalty kick is taken. If the goalie handles the ball in any way, a goal kicks and free kicks or throws by the goalie must touch the floor or be touched by a player before reaching mid-court. If a ball travels over mid-court in the air on a goal kick or goalie throw, the ball will be put in play by the non-offending team by an indirect free kick at mid-court. Rough play (fouls) will be characterized as flagrant and non-flagrant. A flagrant foul will be penalized by a two-minute penalty, as in ice hockey. Violent intentional violations such as pushing, tripping, etc. will bring about this penalty. After a penalty, play resumes with a direct free kick at the spot of the foul. Continual rough play by and individual will result in a game ejection and possible suspension from the league. Non-flagrant fouls will bring about a direct free kick at the point of the violation only. Any problems or questions which arise during a game will be dealt with by the official. One official will be present for all games and their decisions are final. Equipment Intramurals will provide two soccer balls, pennies (to be worn by one of the teams), and goals. No cleats or block-soled shoes may be worn. Length of Games / Timing Games consist of two, 20-minute halves. There will be a five-minute halftime. Games will start on the hour. There will be time for warming up prior to the first game and for 5-10 minutes of warm-up prior to each successive game*(with the exceptions of incidents happening). Games use running time throughout. The clock will be stopped only for injuries or for other extraordinary reasons as the official deems necessary. Goals do not stop the clock. There is no waiting period the game clock starts on the hour. Number of Players / Substitutions There will only be a maximum of 4 players in play during a match (includes the Goalie). Goalie substitutions have to be notified and can only occur on a dead ball. Any other player substitution can be made Location of Games / Court Boundaries Indoor soccer games are played on the in the Basketball court located in the Student Recreation & Fitness Center.
